This is to follow and learn working on git hub

Hello, myself Awais Afzal,

Being programming for last 10 years now and will continue to do so. Am here at git hub to further explore and implore opportunities and see how I can use all my experience in helping with my skillset and do some fulfilling jobs and make a difference...

See you at the other side of the river...

Cheers,
Awais Afzal
